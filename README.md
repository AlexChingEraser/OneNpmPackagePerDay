# OneNpmPackagePerDay

## Background
2021 Sep, I was first learning front dev, and the task is to build a reagent validate platform.

To be honest, my old view about front dev is HTML/CSS, and I have no idea how Javascript make some cool change to broswer(at that time I don't understand is called DOM)

When my leader give a copy of current front code, I was Shocked and what a hell? full of .vue and npm packages(in node_modules).

vue components/vue-router/vuex/moment/axios/element-ui/vue-cli/webpack/babel....It took me a long time to self-study these concepts.When fininsh the platform I mentioned eariler, I think It's a great opportunity to learn dive these cool things and make me feel home in front ecosysytem.

So, maybe I will update some packages I learned and gradually rub these things in a project with front and backend.

## Original Intention
- record: npm packages, front ecosystem, cool tips
- practise skills: vue.js, node.js, gin, mongodb, etc
